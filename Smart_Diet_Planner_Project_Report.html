<div class="section-title">1.1 Project Description</div>
<div class="justify">
    <p>The Smart Diet Planner represents a cutting-edge approach to personal nutrition management, combining artificial intelligence with user-friendly web technology to deliver personalized dietary guidance. In today's fast-paced world, maintaining optimal nutrition has become increasingly challenging due to busy lifestyles, limited knowledge of nutritional requirements, and the complexity of balancing various dietary needs.</p>
    
    <p>This web-based application addresses these challenges by providing an intelligent platform that learns from user preferences, health conditions, and dietary goals to generate customized meal plans and nutritional recommendations. The system incorporates advanced features such as AI-powered meal planning, comprehensive food logging, nutritional analytics, and personalized recommendations based on individual health profiles.</p>
    
    <p>The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive nutrition management system that empowers users to make informed dietary decisions while simplifying the process of meal planning and nutritional tracking. The application serves both regular users seeking to improve their dietary habits and administrators who need to manage the system's food database and user analytics.</p>
    
    <p>Key features of the Smart Diet Planner include user registration and profile management, AI-driven personalized diet plan generation, comprehensive food logging with nutritional tracking, progress monitoring and analytics, admin panel for system management, and integration with Google's Generative AI for intelligent recommendations.</p>

<!-- Chapter 2: Literature Survey -->
<div class="chapter-title">Chapter 2<br>Literature Survey</div>

<div class="section-title">2.1 Existing System</div>
<div class="justify">
    <p>Several nutrition management and diet planning applications currently exist in the market, each with varying capabilities and limitations. Popular applications like MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, and Cronometer provide basic calorie tracking and food logging functionalities but lack sophisticated AI-driven personalization.</p>
    
    <p>Traditional diet planning systems typically rely on static databases and generic recommendations that do not account for individual preferences, cultural dietary habits, or specific health conditions. Most existing systems focus primarily on calorie counting rather than comprehensive nutritional analysis and personalized meal planning.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Limitations of Existing Systems:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Limited personalization capabilities based on individual health profiles</li>
        <li>Lack of AI-driven intelligent recommendations</li>
        <li>Insufficient support for specific dietary preferences and restrictions</li>
        <li>Limited integration with modern AI technologies</li>
        <li>Basic user interface and user experience design</li>

<div class="section-title">4.1 System Perspective</div>
<div class="justify">
    <p>The Smart Diet Planner follows a three-tier architecture pattern consisting of the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. This architectural approach ensures separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> The presentation layer consists of web-based user interfaces built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This layer handles user interactions, input validation, and data presentation. The responsive design ensures optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Business Logic Layer:</strong> The business logic layer is implemented using the Flask web framework and contains the core application logic, including user authentication, diet plan generation, nutritional calculations, and AI integration. This layer processes user requests, applies business rules, and coordinates with external services.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Data Access Layer:</strong> The data access layer utilizes SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the database. This layer handles data persistence, retrieval, and ensures data integrity through proper validation and constraints.</p>
    
    <p>The system integrates with Google's Generative AI service to provide intelligent diet planning capabilities. This external integration enables the system to generate personalized recommendations based on user profiles and preferences.</p>
